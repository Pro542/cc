## Latest projects

- I created an online course called **[Y Combinator for Non-programmers](https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/)**. ([Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/y-combinator-for-non-programmers) / [Blog Post](https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/functional-programming-emojis) / [GitHub Source](https://github.com/chibicode/Y-Combinator-for-Non-programmers))
- I’m working on beginner-friendly TypeScript tutorials called **[TypeScript for Beginner Programmers](https://ts.chibicode.com/)**. Here’s a sample article: “[TypeScript Tutorial for JS Programmers Who Know How to Build a Todo App](https://ts.chibicode.com/todo/)”.
- I co-translated **“[Factfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Factfulness-Reasons-World-Things-Better/dp/1250107814)”** by Hans Rosling, et al. into [Japanese](https://www.amazon.co.jp/FACTFULNESS-%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%83%AB%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B9-10%E3%81%AE%E6%80%9D%E3%81%84%E8%BE%BC%E3%81%BF%E3%82%92%E4%B9%97%E3%82%8A%E8%B6%8A%E3%81%88%E3%80%81%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%82%92%E5%9F%BA%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C%E3%82%92%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%97%E3%81%8F%E8%A6%8B%E3%82%8B%E7%BF%92%E6%85%A3-%E3%83%8F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0/dp/4822289605).

## Looking for a job!

- I’m mainly looking for a **senior engineering position**. But I’m also interested in product-leaning positions (product design, PM, DevRel, etc.) for developer-facing products. I’m better at front-end than back-end, but can do both.
- **Location preference:** Remote would be ideal. 2nd preference is Los Angeles. I’m currently in SF Bay Area (3rd preference), but my wife and I are looking to relocate to LA or other more affordable places.
- **Other preferences:** My last full-time job was in edtech/media, but I’m looking at a wide range of areas. I’m particularly interested in companies that are using AI to solve a problem that doesn’t look like an “AI problem” (see [this article](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/10/4/machine-learning-deployment)). I don’t like doing (and giving) whiteboard/algorithm interviews, but if you ask me to implement Y Combinator on a whiteboard, [I think I’ll do well](https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/).

## Timeline (pre-2017, 2017, 2018, and 2019)

**Work experience (pre-2017):** I worked as a lead full-stack (Rails) developer at [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/), an edtech media startup in Silicon Valley, from 2012 to 2017. I was the first engineering hire and was involved in architecting pretty much all of the projects. Before that, I was a product designer at Quora (2011-2012) and an engineer at Palantir (2010-2011). I studied Computer Science (undergrad) and Human-Computer Interaction (grad) at Carnegie Mellon and won the best teaching assistant award upon graduation.

**In 2017:** After 4.5 years at EdSurge, I spent almost a year traveling to [36 countries and 94 cities](https://2018.chibicode.com/posts/world-travel-2017-2018/). I met my wife along the way.

**In 2018:** While working as a freelance engineer in Silicon Valley, I co-translated a book called **[“Factfulness”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756J1LLV/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_256TDbEEVPQ98)** (by Hans Rosling and others) into Japanese. It went on sale in 2019 and became one of Japan’s top-selling nonfiction books of the year. It’s a great book - [take Bill Gates’s word for it](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Factfulness).

**In 2019:** I spent time marketing the Japanese edition of “Factfulness”, freelancing (Rails dev for small startups), and working on an online course called **[Y Combinator for Non-programmers](https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/)**. I got married and spent a lot of time with my wife, who moved to the U.S. from Japan. And I’m now looking for a full-time job.

## My forte and Interests

**Things I’m pretty good at:** Expository writing (see [my course](https://ycombinator.chibicode.com/)), React/TypeScript (see [this repo](https://github.com/chibicode/Y-Combinator-for-Non-programmers) and also my [TypeScript tutorial series](https://ts.chibicode.com/)), and learning new things quickly. I’m okay at product design. I’ve also worked with Rails from version 2 to version 6.

**Current interests:** As a professional EN → JP translator, I’m interested in machine translation and using AI to augment human translators—how can we use AI to enable human translators to produce higher quality translations?
